# Garden_Simulator

## Description, what about it is 
The project is about simulate a "Garden" habitat with 3 characters: Gardeners, Plants and Pests. 
Plants are damaged by Pests and Gardeners work is prevent Plants of dying with healing.
All the things are done with random scenario, but user chooses the size of map, amount of Pests, Gardeners and Plants, and Plants HP. 

## Things that are used 
To make a Board, I used Swing, AWT, JFrame with base function and commands.
Than in MAIN i made whole menu and settings with spawning my characters.
Next in Tile i choose the colors of tile for specified characters and set the size of tile.
At the end i create objects for Simulation.
